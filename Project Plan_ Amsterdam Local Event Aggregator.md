# Project Plan: Amsterdam Local Event Aggregator

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal is to develop a simple, web-based application that aggregates and displays free or low-cost events and activities happening in Amsterdam. The application aims to help residents and visitors discover affordable entertainment and networking opportunities, fostering community engagement. Revenue generation will be solely through voluntary donation buttons integrated into the platform.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Event Listing and Display

*   **Homepage Display:** A clean and intuitive homepage showcasing upcoming events in a chronological or categorized order.
*   **Event Cards:** Each event will be presented as a card containing essential information such as event name, date, time, a brief description, and an indicator of cost (free/low-cost).

### 2.2. Search and Filtering

*   **Date Filtering:** Users should be able to filter events by specific dates or date ranges (e.g., today, this week, this weekend).
*   **Category Filtering:** Ability to filter events by predefined categories (e.g., music, art, workshops, outdoor, community).
*   **Cost Filtering:** A clear filter to show only free events, low-cost events, or both.
*   **Keyword Search:** A search bar allowing users to find events by keywords in their title or description.

### 2.3. Event Details Page

*   **Comprehensive Information:** A dedicated page for each event providing full details: event name, exact date and time, precise location (with a map link if possible), detailed description, original source link, and specific cost information (if applicable).
*   **Share Options:** Simple options to share event details via social media or direct link.

### 2.4. Donation Integration

*   **Prominent Donation Buttons:** Clearly visible and accessible donation buttons on various pages (e.g., homepage, event details, about page) to encourage user support.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integration with a simple, widely used payment gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) to facilitate donations. (Note: This will be a placeholder for now, as direct payment integration is beyond the scope of a simple, initial build within the sandbox, but the UI elements will be present).

## 3. Technical Stack

To ensure a low-investment, scalable, and maintainable application, the following technical stack is proposed:

*   **Frontend:** `React`
    *   **Reasoning:** React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture, efficiency, and strong community support. It allows for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
*   **Backend:** `Flask`
    *   **Reasoning:** Flask is a lightweight Python web framework. It's ideal for building simple APIs and serving static files, making it a good choice for handling data aggregation, serving the React frontend, and potentially managing event data.
*   **Database:** `SQLite`
    *   **Reasoning:** SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It's perfect for small to medium-sized applications where a full-fledged database server is overkill, requiring no separate server setup or management.
*   **Data Aggregation:** `Python scripts` (using libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, or direct API calls if available).
    *   **Reasoning:** Python is excellent for data processing and web scraping, allowing for flexible and robust data collection from various online sources.
*   **Deployment Environment:** `Manus Sandbox Environment`
    *   **Reasoning:** The sandbox provides pre-configured tools (`manus-create-react-app`, `manus-create-flask-app`, `service_deploy_frontend`, `service_deploy_backend`) that streamline development and deployment, aligning with the low-investment goal.

## 4. Design Principles

*   **Simplicity:** The user interface will be clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate.
*   **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** The design will prioritize mobile usability, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
*   **Accessibility:** Adherence to basic accessibility standards to make the platform usable for a wide audience.
*   **Minimalist Aesthetic:** A clean, modern look with a focus on readability and clear presentation of event information.
*   **Color Palette:** A calm and inviting color scheme, possibly incorporating shades of blue and green to reflect Amsterdam's canals and parks, with contrasting colors for readability.
*   **Typography:** Clear, legible fonts suitable for web display, ensuring event details are easy to read.

## 5. Development Phases Overview

1.  **Define Project Scope, Features, and Technical Stack** (Current Phase)
2.  **Identify and Research Data Sources:** Find reliable online sources for free/low-cost events in Amsterdam (e.g., official city calendars, community event listings, local blogs).
3.  **Develop the Frontend User Interface:** Build the React application, including event listing, search/filter components, and event detail pages.
4.  **Implement Data Aggregation and Display Logic:** Develop Flask backend to scrape/fetch event data, store it in SQLite, and expose it via an API for the frontend.
5.  **Deploy and Test the Application:** Deploy the Flask backend and React frontend within the sandbox environment and conduct testing.
6.  **Deliver the Application and Instructions to the User:** Provide the live URL and instructions on how to use and maintain the application.
