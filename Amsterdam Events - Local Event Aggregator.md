## 🔄 Data Sources Integration

The application is designed to easily integrate with real data sources:

### Current Implementation
- Sample data stored in `src/routes/events.py`
- 10 realistic events covering various categories
- Easy to replace with live data

### Potential Data Sources
1. **I amsterdam** (iamsterdam.com) - Official tourism website
2. **Eventbrite** - Event platform with free events
3. **Local venues** - Direct partnerships
4. **Community submissions** - User-generated content

### Integration Steps
1. **Web Scraping**: Use BeautifulSoup to scrape event websites
2. **API Integration**: Connect to official APIs where available
3. **Database Storage**: Store events in SQLite/PostgreSQL
4. **Automated Updates**: Schedule regular data updates

## 💰 Monetization Implementation

### Current Donation System
The donation functionality is implemented with placeholder alerts. To make it functional:

1. **Payment Processor Integration**
   - Stripe: Most popular, easy integration
   - PayPal: Widely accepted
   - Mollie: Popular in Netherlands

2. **Implementation Example (Stripe)**
```javascript
// Frontend
const handleDonation = async (amount) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/create-payment-intent', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ amount: amount * 100 }) // Convert to cents
  });
  // Handle Stripe payment flow
};
```

3. **Backend Payment Endpoint**
```python
@app.route('/api/create-payment-intent', methods=['POST'])
def create_payment():
    # Stripe payment intent creation
    # Return client secret for frontend
```
